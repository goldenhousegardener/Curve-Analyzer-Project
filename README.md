Curve Analyzer Project

Technical Instructions

1. Working Folder Structure
In the folder named AA (named after the patient's code), there are three files.
Each file contains three sections:

    ‚àò Right side of the mandible
    ‚àò Left side (located at the center of the file)
    ‚àò Incisal region (lower part of the file)

One of the files is named AXIO. It contains the axiographic trace generated by the Modjaw¬Æ system, which includes two condylar angles‚Äîone for the right side and one for the left.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional Program Requirements

The program must be capable of:

1.Calculating the degrees of condylar slopes from the records.
2.Associating this information with the other two files of the same patient (those containing mandibular data).
3.Exporting all results to a spreadsheet, with a clear structure Ffor further analysis.

Expected Structure of the Spreadsheet

Rows:
Each row will represent a patient, identified by their initials or code (e.g., "AA").

Columns:
The columns will be labeled based on the combination of record type and functional segment.
There will be 4 blocks, each corresponding to a condition or state under which the record was taken (e.g., "arbitrary right", "arbitrary left", "hinge right", etc.).
Each block will include 4 columns, corresponding to functional segments T1, T2, T3, and T4.

Example:
For the record file ‚Äúarbitrary right‚Äù (AD):
A block with 4 columns will be generated:
AD_T1, AD_T2, AD_T3, AD_T4

This structure will be repeated for each type of record (AI, AD, BI, BD).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

üìÑ Final Output Example
A simplified version of the spreadsheet should look like this:

    Patient	AD_T1	AD_T2	AD_T3	AD_T4	AI_T1	AI_T2	AI_T3	AI_T4	...
    AA	10.2	11.4	9.8	8.5	12.0	11.1	10.5	9.9	...
    BB	...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...	...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Statistical Functions Required
You have already implemented the following:

 ‚àò Standard deviation (SD) of angular slopes
 ‚àò Comparisons between axes (AI, AXIO, BI, etc.) using:

     ‚àò Paired Student‚Äôs t-tests
     ‚àò Normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk)
     ‚àò 95% confidence intervals (CI)
     ‚àò Effect size (Cohen‚Äôs d)

 ‚àò Functional segmentation by segments T1 to T4
 ‚àò Intraindividual angular comparisons, without population-level extrapolation
